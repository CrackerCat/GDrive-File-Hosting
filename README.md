# GDrive File Hosting
Use Google Drive as your storage for your file hosting service instead real server storage. Saves your money from paying big server

An anonymous modder gave this to me without any documentation, so we don't know excatly how to use it. I believe you must pay more storage on Google Drive for more storage or get unlimited storage if you have a company or if you are a student, you can set this up with some sort of your token

See this page how to use Google Drive API: https://developers.google.com/drive

Be a webmaster and have PHP, SQL and JS programming skills
